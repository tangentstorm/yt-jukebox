YouTube Karaoke Jukebox

** about

This project helps you organize your own YouTube-powered karaoke night.

** current features:

(nothing to see yet.)

** upcoming features:

- Full-screen YouTube powered video player that reads its playlist and start/stop commands from a server. (So guests never see a mouse cursor or even a browser window.)
- KJs can manage the playlist, and control the video player from a separate browser through an HTML interface on a completely separate machine.
- Guests can log in with their Google profile and request songs (or any other video they find on YouTube.)

** made with:

Still working this out, but at the moment it looks like:

- A Chrome extension to manage the "player" browser.
- Plain old HTML5 + JS for the user and admin screens (with maybe a little d3.js or jQuery thrown in) 
- FireBase realtime database to store data, handle authentication, and keep all the pieces in sync.
