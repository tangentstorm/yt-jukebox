* MILESTONE: "karaoke night"
- [ ] public interface
    - [ ] users can add name,artist,song
- [ ] kj interface
    - [ ] kj can manually rearrange the queue
    - [ ] the list tracks which ones have been played
- [ ] player system
    - we can't host our own page because most karaoke content won't let the iframe player play off of any site except youtube.com.
    - so: we need to inject some javascript into our own browser on youtube.com.
      - easy: run a script manually in the console
      - chrome user script
      - install as chrome extension?



* MILESTONE: "power users":
  - [ ] give users the ability to manage their list of favorite songs.
  - [ ] users can submit a song to the queue
     (youtube link, artist, their name)




* misc notes
